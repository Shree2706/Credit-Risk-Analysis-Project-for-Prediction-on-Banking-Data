# Credit-Risk-Analysis-Project-for-Prediction-on-Banking-Data
# Problem Statement
Develop a deep understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
# Solution 
This project helps the company to make a decision based on the applicant’s profile like if the applicant is likely to
repay the loan or not.
# About Dataset 
This dataset basically contains information about bank details ,various client details which consists of multiple tables which are interlinked with each other through keys like primary key and foreign key.
The various tables are Banking Relationship, Client-Banking, Gender, Investment Advisor and Period.
# Insights 
1. The strongest positive correlation occur among "Bank Deposits" with "Checking Accounts", "Saving Accounts" and "Foreign Currency Account" indicating that customers who maintain high balances in one account type often hold substantial amount/funds across other accounts as well.

2. Deposits and Savings Behavior The high correlation between Bank Deposits and Saving Accounts suggests that these may either measure overlapping financial behavior (e.g., total funds a customer keeps in the bank) or that people who actively deposit funds also tend to maintain or grow savings balances.

3. Income, Age, and Accumulation Moderate correlations of Age and Estimated Income with various balances (Superannuation, Savings, Checking) reflect a common financial lifecycle trend: higher income earners and older individuals often accumulate more savings, retirement funds, and may carry higher credit card balances or loans.

4. Low Correlation with Properties Owned Property ownership may depend on external factors (location, real estate market conditions, inheritance, etc.) that are not captured by these particular banking variables. Hence, we see weaker correlations here.

5. Business vs. Personal Banking Business Lending’s moderate link to Bank Loans suggests some customers may have both personal and business debts. However, business lending is relatively uncorrelated with other deposit or property-related metrics, indicating it may serve a distinct subset of customers or needs.
